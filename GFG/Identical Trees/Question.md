Identical Trees


Given two binary trees with their root nodes root1 and root2, return true if both of them are identical, otherwise, false.
Note: Two trees are identical when they have the same data and the arrangement of data is also the same

Examples:

Input: root1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], root2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: true
Explanation: There are two trees both having 4 nodes and 3 edges, both trees are identical.
Input: root1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], root2 = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]
 
Output: false
Explanation: There are two trees both having 4 nodes and 3 edges, but both trees are not identical.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 109
